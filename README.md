# Overview
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to cluster different types of bitcoins based on their algorithm, proof type, how many of them have been mined, and how many there are of them in total.

# Results
The data was transformed using Principal Component analysis to make three new axes to plot the data on. The following image shows the resulting data clusters on the new axes.

The clusters were also plotted to view the Total Coin Supply vs. Total Coins Mined. However, there does not appear to be any easily discernable trends.
